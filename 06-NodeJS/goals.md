# LEARNING GOALS

We’ve reached a milestone having covered the topics in front end technologies!  Now, we’re going to explore the other side of the stack, namely back end technologies. Being able to work with Node.js is going to allow us to build the back end of a full stack product.

NodeJS is a program that allows JavaScript to run on a computer (the server). So far we have seen Javascript running on a browser.  Running Javascript on a back end server allows us to serve dynamic web pages, communicate with other servers, e.g. other websites and database servers, and generally act as a glue for the whole system.

ES6

In learning about Node and related technologies, we are going to use modern Javascript features which are collectively called ES6.  This week we will begin with learning about ES6.
ES6 refers to version 6 of the ECMA Script programming language. ECMA Script is the standardized name for JavaScript and ES6 is the next version after what is called ES5 or Version 5 
which was released in 2011.

ECMAScript, or ES6 standards were released in June 2015.  They were subsequently renamed to ECMAScript 2015.  ES6 is a major enhancement to the JavaScript language, and adds many more features intended to make large-scale software development easier.
