# LEARNING GOALS

  Welcome to APIs! APIs are an important subject and many companies will ask if you know how to use them, so please pay careful attention to the materials this week. You will be using everything that you’ve learned up until this point (HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, JS/Node/Express, EJS, etc.)  
  
  With APIs, we can now draw data from external resources, e.g. weather data, restaurant reviews, twitter feeds, youtube videos, github repositories and users, names of your congresspersons and senators, currency conversion etc.  In this project, we will be building our own restaurant finding application. When a user enters their city, they would get a list of restaurants near their specified location.

#  PROJECTS

#### Project 1: Food Finder

1. We will be using the public API from Yelp. In order to use it, you’ll need to create an account on Yelp. From the developers page, you’ll need to retrieve your client ID, and API key: https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app

1. You will also be using the Yelp nodejs module. This module will make it easier for us to make requests. https://www.npmjs.com/package/yelp-fusion

1. You will also need EJS and Express.

1. You should also look at the Yelp documentation, especially on the search parameters when making requests: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started

1. Create two main pages: 
  - home.ejs page, and 
  - searchresults.ejs page.

1. The home.ejs page has a form that allows a user to enter a city. When they hit the submit button, it should take them to the searchresults.ejs page where the a list of restaurants is displayed.

1. The searchresults.ejs page should display upto 10 search results. They should be linked to their respective Yelp page, and an image of their rating should be next to each link.

1. Use bootstrap for styling.

1. Use partials to hold your boilerplate header and footer HTML code.

1. This project will exercise your ability to drill down on an object. If you need help, ask!!
