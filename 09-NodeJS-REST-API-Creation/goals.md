## 1.2 Deliverables & Success Criteria
	1.2.1 	Restful API routes as described in the project section below.
	1.2.2   Self documented code that would provide a Business Analyst enough information about the code 
            and the tests.

## 2.0 Learning Agenda

2.0.1   HTTP Codes and Chrome Devtools Review

2.0.2 Automating the Tests for your API

Next, we will create tests to test the API routes we create as shown here. Remember, these videos are to learn. You may adopt and adapt the code patterns to suit the project as needed. If in doubt, please ask.
