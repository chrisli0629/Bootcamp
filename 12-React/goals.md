# WORK IN PROGRESS - not finalized!!!!

# LEARNING GOALS

For the next four to six classes, we will be talking about React.
React is a front end JavaScript framework that is great for building single page applications and mobile apps.
React is a view library that uses something called “components”
Since everything in React is a component, you can frequently reuse these components




## Self Learning Assignment

## Lecture 1 - Introduction

What is React and why should we use it?

## Lecture 2 - Props

Props is how we pass variables from one component to another.

## State

Any time there are changes to data,  or changes to the 'state' of your page, we need to be able to make sure your page updates.

## Routing

When dealing with links and routing, React has a special way of making sure the correct component loads
This is done with React-Router.

Also, we need to up our understanding on the way CSS works with different components and the way they are mounted.

## APIs

So we an build a page, and we can pass props and state with our components IF we supply the data.
But what if we need the data from an outside source?
