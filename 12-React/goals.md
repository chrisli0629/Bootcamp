# LEARNING GOALS

For the next four to six classes, we will be talking about React.
React is a front end JavaScript framework that is great for building single page applications and mobile apps.
React is a view library that uses something called “components”
Since everything in React is a component, you can frequently reuse these components

After all 5 lectures, you should be able to:

		1. Use create-react-app to build a basic app template
		2. Understand the difference between HTML and JSX
		3. Be able to pass props from one component 'down' to another
		4. Be able to set state of a component as needed
		5. Use React-Router to navigate to different components as needed
		6. Basic (re)understanding of CSS and how it behaves differently with React - Router
		7. Use a basic library (such as Fetch) in order to consume an API
		8. Experiment with different ideas in order to complete projects
		9. Use Chrome react tools to assist in all aspects of React development
		

## Self Learning Assignment

KNOW where this resource is: [Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org)   This is the number one place to go for questions and understanding of React.
You WILL use it quite often. Start here. Familiarize yourself with concepts like components, JSX, props, and state.


Your next assignment is to watch the videos in this link, and to work through the exercise in the videos. 
This is a course from Wes Bos, and you can read more here: (https://reactforbeginners.com/)

React is a great way to build apps, especially if that application is going to change on a regular basis.
BUT it requires time and interactiveness. The above videos (tutorials) are a great way to get an understanding.
Please understand, you are not going to get all this in one pass. 
These videos are great way to get your feet wet and take through the entire process of creating an application and preparing for deployment.
They also show you how to attach your app to a database (something we will not be covering in class).

Recommendation: watch the videos, code along, take notes (manually and inside your code).
Overall, I believe there are over 40 hours of video. This is NOT meant to be rushed through.
Take your time, and go through ALL the lessons. 


## Lecture 1 - Introduction

What is React and why should we use it?

## Lecture 2 - Props

Props is how we pass properties (variables) from one component to another. How do we know this is actually
happening? We can use certain tools available through Chrome to assist with our development.
What is destructuring and how to use so you can speed up your coding and make more legible.
How to use mapping and keys to build your components and ensure uniqueness.

## Lecture 3 - State

Any time there are changes to data,  or changes to the 'state' of your page, we need to be able to make sure your page updates.
Remember, props cannot change. However, state can, so how do we utilize this to our advantage.
After a more in depth look at props, and how to map various data that we hard code, we can now change the state,
change the data, that is passed.

We can use a a simple form input to show how state is created (this.state), and changed (this.setState).

## Lecture 4 - Routing

When dealing with links and routing, React has a special way of making sure the correct component loads
This is done with React-Router.

Also, we need to up our understanding on the way CSS works with different components and the way they are mounted.

## Lecture 5 - APIs

Currently, you can build a basic react app and you can pass props and state with your components IF you supply the data.
But what if we need the data from an outside source? 
Using fetch(), you are now going to be able build a basic app that consumes data from a third party
and display the results with basic component building.

## Projects

Under the Projects folder, there are multiple projects to expand your React skills:

#### boxes.md

These projects will expand upon your knowledge learned in lectures 1 and 2. 
The challenges will arise when you must determine when and how props are passed.

#### movies.md

This project will take all your knowledge learned in lectures 1-5 and apply them in a way to push your
knowledge of CSS, APIs, props, and components


#### tic-tac-toe.md 

Go to this link and BUILD the tic-tac toe game: (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
This is great exercise on passing props and state.

Once you feel comfortable with this, then follow the instructions under the tic-tac-toe.md and 
make the changes as described to give you a more customized game. - UNDER CONSTRUCTION
