# LEARNING GOALS

For the next four to six classes, we will be talking about React.
React is a front end JavaScript framework that is great for building single page applications and mobile apps.
React is a view library that uses something called “components”
Since everything in React is a component, you can frequently reuse these components

After all 5 lectures, you should be able to:
		1. Use create-react-app to build a basic app template
		2. Understand the difference between HTML and JSX
		3. Be able to pass props from one component 'down' to another
		4. Be able to set state of a component as needed
		5. Use React-Router to navigate to different components as needed
		6. Basic (re)understanding of CSS and how it behaves differently with React - Router
		7. Use a basic library (such as Fetch) in order to consume an API
		8. Experiment with different ideas in order to complete projects
		9. Use Chrome react tools to assist in all aspects of React development
		

## Self Learning Assignment

## Lecture 1 - Introduction

What is React and why should we use it?

## Lecture 2 - Props

Props is how we pass properties (variables) from one component to another. How do we know this is actually
happening? We can use certain tools available through Chrome to assist with our development.
What is destructuring and how to use so you can speed up your coding and make more legible.
How to use mapping and keys to build your components and ensure uniqueness.

## Lecture 3 - State

Any time there are changes to data,  or changes to the 'state' of your page, we need to be able to make sure your page updates.
Remember, props cannot change. However, state can, so how do we utilize this to our advantage.
After a more in depth look at props, and how to map various data that we hard code, we can now change the state,
change the data, that is passed.

We can use a a simple form input to show how state is created (this.state), and changed (this.setState).

## Lecture 4 - Routing

When dealing with links and routing, React has a special way of making sure the correct component loads
This is done with React-Router.

Also, we need to up our understanding on the way CSS works with different components and the way they are mounted.

## Lecture 5 - APIs

Currently, you can build a basic react app and you can pass props and state with your components IF you supply the data.
But what if we need the data from an outside source? 
Using fetch(), you are now going to be able build a basic app that consumes data from a third party
and display the results with basic component building.

## Projects

Under the Projects folder, there are two sets of projects:

### boxes.md

These projects will expand upon your knowledge learned in lectures 1 and 2. 
The challenges will arise when you must determine when and how props are passed.

### movies.md

This project will take all your knowledge learned in lectures 1-5 and apply them in a way to push your
knowledge of CSS, APIs, props, and components
