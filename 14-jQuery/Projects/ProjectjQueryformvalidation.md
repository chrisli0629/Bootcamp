# Project: jQuery form validation


We’ve done form validation before, and now we’re going to do it again with jQuery.


You’re going to create a form with two fields: email and password. If an incorrect email is entered, a message in red is displayed that says 'You must enter a valid email.' If the password is shorter than 6 characters, it will say 'Your password is too short.'

For this project, you will be using a little bit of Regular Expressions in order to validate the user’s email address. While you don’t need to write your own expression (you can just go a Google search for one), this would be a good idea to familiarize yourself with what Regular Expressions are and how they work: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions


Note: you will also want to disable Chrome’s built-in email validator by adding the ‘novalidate’ attribute to your form tag (otherwise theres no point to this project!):  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16269075/disable-remove-the-default-input-type-email-validation-text-overlay-in-fire
