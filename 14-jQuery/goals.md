# LEARNING GOALS - Week 9

We're back to learning about the front end again! We'll be learning jQuery for about a week. It's a JavaScript library that will help us with DOM manipulation.


### The DOM

Understanding the Document Object Model is foundational for web programming.  We'll talk about the DOM in 
class.  For a more detailed look at how a DOM is represented in memory and rendered on the browser, review
this online tutorial

## Self Learning Assignment

  [jQuery In-Depth from jQuery](https://learn.jquery.com/)

  Use this resource as a reference.  When in doubt, you should refer to this resource, or ask an instructor.

For learning purpose, you may go through one of the following to get an intro to jQuery.  Try both and see which one you prefer.  Both are very credible sources and have done a good job.  There are multiple other resources.  I'll provide links to a couple of books below as well.

  [Learn jQuery from Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-js-jquery)

or

  [Getting Started with jQuery from Channel9 at MSDN](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Javascript-Fundamentals-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners/Getting-Started-with-jQuery-14)

or, if you prefer a text book format, you may use
