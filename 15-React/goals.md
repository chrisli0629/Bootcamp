# React.js

## Learning Goals

Welcome to React!

React is a front end framework that was created by Facebook in 2013. It has since exploded in popularity in the web/mobile developer community.

React is going to be the last big topic that we will be talking about in the bootcamp. After that, the focus will be on mastering everything that we've learned and using this knowledge to build meaningful real life web applications.

After the lectures, you should be able to:

    1. Use create-react-app to build a basic app template
    2. Understand the difference between HTML and JSX
    3. Be able to pass props from one component 'down' to another
    4. Be able to set state of a component as needed
    5. Use React-Router to navigate to different components as needed
    6. Basic (re)understanding of CSS and how it behaves differently with React - Router
    7. Use a basic library (such as Fetch) in order to consume an API
    8. Experiment with different ideas in order to complete projects
    9. Use Chrome React Dev tools to assist in all aspects of React development

## Self Learning Resources

There are several good resources.  You may pick one and learn from it, depending on whether you prefer watching videos, learning from documentation and getting started tutorials, or books.

When you combine these with in-classroom lectures and Q&A with instructors and mentors, you should be able to learn fairly quickly.

The key is to be comfortable with not knowing everything at first and asking for help often.
This is NOT meant to be rushed through.  Take your time, and go through all the lessons.

1. #### [Slide Deck - React & JSX](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mhQswX7z9sbmCsJzbl2i36GaRJJ6oXejaTsDt8shmfc/edit?usp=sharing)

1. #### [Slide Deck - Create React App & Props](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D-k5gAjfrPC1MW0DUm_z2pSoyouhZJJO6JHfZOoHAjE/edit?usp=sharing)

1. #### [Slide Deck - State](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hxhLrWDB1Fb7qnLRpHk0Giwxw3cY2Vig9fpYJb5qltc/edit?usp=sharing)


1. #### [React by Facebook, Getting Started Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

    This is for those that like to code along as they learn. Many students like learning this way, but not all do.  Pros: very fast, Cons: you need to piece a lot of different things together in your mind, and need to be comfortable not understanding everything at first.

1. #### [React Step by Step Guide by Facebook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)

    This is a learning style I enjoyed. You mileage may vary. This is for those who has a lot of "why" questions along with learning how to code in React.

1. #### [The Road to Learn React - Robin Wieruch - PDF Book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1II-z0lwejYp5941mmydfaoNHWCwPa_kW/view?usp=sharing)  

    This book is part of Robin's Road to React Course.  I found that the Beginner (free) course covers almost everything you need to know about React before we dive into our Final Project.

    He provides a lot of code to review and work off of, using links to github repositories.

1. #### [React Courses on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)

    When looking for courses on Udemy, there are many many great choices.  For some it is the pace, or length, or comprehensiveness.  Many like the voice of a certain instructor more than others.  You cannot go wrong with any of the following. The only catch is they are quite long.

    1.1 [Andrew Mead](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/)

    1.2 [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)
  
    1.3 [Maximillian Schwartzmuller](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)


1. #### [React Tutorials by The Net Ninja - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ij8CfkAY2RAGb-tmkNwQHG)
    This provides a good, short overview and has been very liked by some of our past students.

# Lectures

## Lecture 1 - Introduction

What is React and why should we use it?

## Lecture 2 - Props

Props is how we pass properties (variables) from one component to another. How do we know this is actually happening? We can use certain tools available through Chrome to assist with our development.

What is destructuring and how to use so you can speed up your coding and make more legible.
How to use mapping and keys to build your components and ensure uniqueness.

## Lecture 3 - State

Any time there are changes to data,  or changes to the 'state' of your page, we need to be able to make sure your page updates.

Remember, props cannot change. However, state can, so how do we utilize this to our advantage.
After a more in depth look at props, and how to map various data that we hard code, we can now change the state, change the data, that is passed.

We can use a a simple form input to show how state is created (this.state), and changed (this.setState).

## Lecture 4 - Routing

When dealing with links and routing, React has a special way of making sure the correct component loads.  This is done with React-Router.

Also, we need to up our understanding on the way CSS works with different components and the way they are mounted.

## Lecture 5 - APIs

Currently, you can build a basic react app and you can pass props and state with your components IF you supply the data.

But what if we need the data from an outside source? 

Using fetch(), you are now going to be able build a basic app that consumes data from a third party and display the results with basic component building.

# Projects

Under the Projects folder, there are multiple projects to expand your React skills:

- [Boxes Project - link](./Projects/boxes.md)

	These projects will expand upon your knowledge learned in lectures 1 and 2. The challenges will arise when you must determine when and how props are passed.

- [Movies Project - link](./Projects/movies.md)

	This project will take all your knowledge learned in lectures 1-5 and apply them in a way to push your knowledge of CSS, APIs, props, and components


- [Tic-Tac-Toe Project - link](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

	Go to this link and BUILD the tic-tac toe game.  This is great exercise on passing props and state.

	Once you feel comfortable with this, then follow the instructions under the tic-tac-toe .md file and make the changes as described to give you a more customized game. - UNDER CONSTRUCTION
