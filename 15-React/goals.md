### React Goals

Welcome to React!

React is a front end framework that was created by Facebook in 2013. It has since exploded in popularity in the web/mobile developer community.

React is going to be the last big topic that we will be talking about in the bootcamp. After that, the focus will be on mastering everything that we've learned and using this knowledge to build meaningful real life web applications.

## Self Learning Assignments

There are several good resources.  You may pick one and learn from it, depending on whether you prefer watching videos, learning from documentation and getting started tutorials, or books.

When you combine these with in-classroom lectures and Q&A with instructors and mentors, you should be able to learn fairly quickly.

The key is to be comfortable with not knowing everything at first and asking for help often.

1. #### [React by Facebook, Getting Started Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

This is for those that like to code along as they learn. Many students like learning this way, but not all do.  Pros: very fast, Cons: you need to piece a lot of different things together in your mind, and need to be comfortable not understanding everything at first.

1. #### [React Step by Step Guide by Facebook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)

    This is a learning style I enjoyed. You mileage may vary. This is for those who has a lot of "why" questions along with learning how to code in React.

1. #### [The Road to Learn React - Robin Wieruch - PDF Book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1II-z0lwejYp5941mmydfaoNHWCwPa_kW/view?usp=sharing)  

    This book is part of Robin's Road to React Course.  I found that the Beginner (free) course covers almost everything you need to know about React before we dive into our Final Project.

    He provides a lot of code to review and work off of, using links to github repositories.

1. #### [React Courses on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)

    When looking for courses on Udemy, there are many many great choices.  For some it is the pace, or length, or comprehensiveness.  Many like the voice of a certain instructor more than others.  You cannot go wrong with any of the following. The only catch is they are quite long.

    1.1 [Andrew Mead](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/)

    1.2 [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)
  
    1.3 [Maximillian Schwartzmuller](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)


1. #### [React Tutorials by The Net Ninja - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ0f1Apb5CU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i0_2FF-WhtRIfIJ1lXlTZR)
  This provides a good, short overview and has been very liked by some of our past students.
