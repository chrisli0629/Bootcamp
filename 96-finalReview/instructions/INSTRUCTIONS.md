### Master Copy

##### Saturday, July 27, 2019

</center>

# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Clone or git pull or download this `finalReview` folder to your local disk. Also simultaneously, view the webpages for the questions, to be able to see the code screenshots.

1. Copy the `finalReview` folder over to your ACCSoftwareBootcamp group's personal repository, so you may edit the contents there and push them.  

    For example, get the questions from

    https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Jan_2019/finalReview

    And push your answers to

    https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/\<yourname>\/finalReview

1. There's a folder for each question.  Please paste your answers within the respective folder, in a file or files named something like `answer.md` or `answer.js`.  

1. This review is in 2 parts

    1. **Small questions**.  These have equal weight and total upto 60% of the evaluation.

    2. **Practical portion**.  This is a small project, similar to class project that has 40% of the evaluation.

1. This review is open book.  You may use all references available to you to answer the questions.

1. If a code snippet on the review has a bug, please feel free to fix it and then answer. There are some intentional bugs in sample code provided. This is much like the real world.

1. To make sure you have enough time for all questions, return to the difficult ones later.  Do not get stuck on them.

1. Please git commit, git push your answers to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository only.  Git pushes are time stamped.  Those time stamps would be used to evaluate the answers.  If you do not complete the material, you would be given extra time.  You would get graded on both sets of answers, the on-time answers and the late answers.  Your final grade would depend on both answers. The late answers would attract a small penalty.


### INTEGRITY: 

Remember this final review is a test of how well prepared you are. You need a honest answer as much. Trying to bypass the process by copying answers, will not help with that goal. While some of the questions may appear difficult, they CAN be answered with some amount of research. It is more important to learn from this experience, than bypass it. As such, let us set some ground rules

- No sharing of direct or indirect answers
- Absolutely no sharing of answer code
- No sharing of url references, your peers can search too ;-)
- Some of you may be asked to explain your answers after the review, if the answers are not clear
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#final-students** such that all students have access to the same clarification. 


### EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. Evidence of understanding of the underlying concepts related to the question. Can you answer the "why?" where asked?  Your answer should be within a sentence or two.  Long answers are not needed as they take away precious time. (20% weightage)

1. How complete is your answer and/or your code.  Code is complete if it can handle all possible inputs, e.g. user error (20% weightage).

1. Have you annotated your code with comments so it is reasonably understandable?  Have you indented your code appropriately? Very long comments are not needed. The comments should be sufficient for an experienced developer to follow your solution. (20% weightage)

1. Does your code work, where applicable? (40% weightage).


### PASSING CRITERIA & SCORING STRATEGIES

1. 70% of overall score is needed for success. 

1. You may take upto 5:00 pm on the review day to complete the review. Please remember to commit/push your answers before 5:00 pm.

1. Some credit is given for partially complete or partly correct answers as well. Hence we do not recommend skipping questions completely.

1. Do attempt the practical portion and push it, even if it doesn't work. You cannot succeed without attempting the practical portion, as it holds 40% of the overall grade value. Even non-working practical portion may attract enough credit to put you over the 70% mark.

1. If you do not succeed at this review, you will get another opportunity to retake the review, without any repercussion. The only condition is that you must complete the process before the end of August 2019.
