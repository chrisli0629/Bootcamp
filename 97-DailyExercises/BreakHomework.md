While this is a break, it is a perfect time to catch up on the topics that you were
not able to complete in the previous weeks.  Please set aside several hours each day
where you go through the past projects and pick up the projects that you were not able
to complete.  In addition, please block off some time to work on the following tasks as well ...


### 1. Whip up your resume (suggested 30 min).  

A resume is a brochure of you.  It gives a quick peek into who you are and what you
are looking for.  It markets your skills.  It needs to quickly and easily catch the
attention of the person looking at your resume. 

Remember, people who look at resumes are ones that spend hours looking at dozens of 
resumes.  In addition to being easy to peruse, your resume should give the peruser
a quick yay/nay decision, preferably the former.  

And most reviewers are looking for a good over lap of the skills they are looking for.
Some may be looking for a college degree.  Others may look for years of experience.
You should add a couple of lines at the top that suggest why they should choose "yay"
on your resume. 

*Task*:  Look for an entry-mid level Web Developer advertised position on Indeed.com
or another site.  Prepare your resume to address the needs of that job posting.  Cover
as much of their requirement as you would be able to at this time.  

For some class or instructor feedback on your resume, please push your
resume on your github repository.  And then ask for feedback.  This is the time to not
be shy and resist the feeling that I am not ready for marketing myself :-)  This is just
to give your personal brochure (er, resume) a look-over.


### 2. Create a personal profile page (suggested 3-6 hrs).

Creating a personal profile page is not only a good option to catch potential hiring
managers' attention, but also an excellent extra project to practice HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
(if you use these).

Here are a very good examples of personal profile pages ... You don't need to copy or
match these.  These are only some of the best ones we have seen.  You may go below or 
above the UI features of these.

### 3. Complete Your Online React Course

Completing online courses is very rewarding and yet challenging on account of the volume
of material covered by most courses.  Try to complete your selected React course.  You may
be thinking that I am not comfortable with Web Dev basics, and I'll postpone React.  That
is natural.  We would suggest that in the process of watching / reading React courses, you 
would learn more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 


Yes, breaks do rust our engines and firing them up keeps them running.  Please set aside some
time to do these.  If you have other suggestions, please post them on #general.
