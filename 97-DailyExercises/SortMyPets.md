I have an object which contains information about all my pets.  Create a JS function which outputs the same object structure, 
but my pets are sorted by the quantity of food I need for them, each day.  
Sample data ...

var myPets = {
    "camel" : {
        "name": "Wednesday",
        "age": 8,
        "food": "Hay, mostly",
        "daily food quantity": 30
    },
    "cobra" : {
        "name": "Slitherio",
        "age": 2,
        "food": "Rodents",
        "daily food quantity": 0.05
    },
    "elephant" : {
        "name": "Hathi",
        "age": 12,
        "food": "Plant matter, grass, hay, fruit",
        "daily food quantity": 50
    }
}
