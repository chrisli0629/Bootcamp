## Question A:

What color would you expect the item Sweet Halwa to show as and why?

<img src="images/1.png" width=45%>
<img src="images/2.png" width=45% style="padding-left:10px;">

## Question B:

What color would you expect the item "Sausage" to show as and why?

<div>
   <img src="images/a.png" width=90%>
</div>
<div style="padding: 10px 0 10px 0;">
    <img src="images/b.png" width=90%>
</div>



## Solution here please ...

#### Solution A

It would be blue because it is the first item to have the `.highlight:nth-of-type(odd)` class.

#### Solution B

It would be blue because the id style has the highest priority, and has a higher specificity than `ul li`.
