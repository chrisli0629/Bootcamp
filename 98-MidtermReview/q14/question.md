Your task is to make a JS function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits re-arranged in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

Also, ensure that an invalid input would return 0 and that you are returning an integer.


Hint: you may use several Number, String and Array methods chained together to arrive at the desired result. 

### Examples:

    Input: 21445 Output: 54421

    Input: 145263 Output: 654321

    Input: 1254859723 Output: 9875543221
