## Instructions

This is the front-end ToDo app that is used as a basis for development of
the full stack ToDo app.

Please review this code as we would make this a basis for further development.

You may wish to download this code to your computer and edit it there using 
you Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of choice.  

If you prefer coding in this environment(i.e. Plunker), 

- please fork this code so you may make changes to this code in your own copy of this code.
- make sure that your back-end rest API is deployed to a publicly accessible location.  I 
suggest deploying it to Heroku or AWS.  I'll walk you through deploying to Heroku in class.
