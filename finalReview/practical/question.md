# Final Exam Project

</center>

In this section you have 2 choices.  **Do one of these, not both.**  

Once you are done, push it to your ACCSoftwareBootcamp personal repository on github.com.

# Choice 1:

This project is designed to test your knowledge of the front end as well as the back end. You will be building an application that allows users to find information about Star Wars characters. 

The home page should look like this: 

<img src="images/swapi1.png" alt="" width="50%">

When they click on Submit, they are taken to a page that should display the name, height, and hair color of that character. (Limit your search results to just the first 10 movie characters, ie. https://swapi.co/api/people/1 to https://swapi.co/api/people/10)

You will be using the The Starwars Database API.  https://swapi.co/
Read over the documentation and familiarize yourself with how to use it.  You may use one of the wrapper modules if you choose.
