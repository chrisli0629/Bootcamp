### Question

Write a query which lists all the players that were born after Aaron Brooks.  Write it without hard coding Brooks' date of birth, since upon review, the actual DOB data may be changed.  

Hints: 

- Please examine the database for what these tables contain and how they are structured.
- You may use a sub-query for this question.
